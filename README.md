## 🔒 Dual‑Layer Quantum‑Resilient Architecture
lumi‑os adopts a dual‑layer quantum‑resilient architecture designed for the post‑quantum era.

### Base Layer (Foundational Quantum Countermeasures)
A core‑integrated, foundational quantum‑resistant structure.

### Operational Layer (Runtime Quantum Countermeasures)
A dynamic quantum‑resilience mechanism applied during runtime, operating independently from the base layer.


## 🔒 Quantum‑Triad Architecture (Design Phase)
While the current implementation is based on a dual‑layer model,
lumi‑os is evolving toward a long‑term three‑layer quantum architecture (gav / my / me).
This architecture is currently in the design phase.

- **gav‑Layer (Global Quantum Anchor)** — Planned. The foundational anchor layer
  responsible for stabilizing the ontology system.
- **my‑Layer (Modular Quantum Yield)** — Conceptual design in progress.
- **me‑Layer (Micro‑Execution Quantum Shield)** — Conceptual design in progress.

This triad model represents the long‑term direction of lumi‑os rather than a
fully implemented feature at this stage.

These are not promotional claims but structural requirements essential to the integrity of the LUMINA BULIGE ecosystem.


## 🌐 3C Sub‑Brand Architecture
This project is built under the 3C sub‑brand:

- **Creative** — Generates new structures, expressions, and world‑building elements  
- **Connected** — Ensures interoperability between modules, languages, and APIs  
- **Core** — Serves as the central OS (Ontology System) of the LUMINA BULIGE world  

The system is composed of modules designed under the Neo / New Generation concept.


## 🚀 Neo / New Generation
Neo / New Generation represents a next‑generation framework that surpasses traditional structural limitations, enabling:

- Transparency  
- Safety  
- Scalability  

Through its patent‑pending core technology, lumi‑os achieves:

- **Dynamic boundary management** — Strict preservation of user‑defined rules and permissions  
- **Layered extensibility** — Consistent behavior from minimal setups to complex structures  
- **Structural safety** — Architectural mechanisms that eliminate systemic risks in advance  


## 🧬 Patent Pending Technology
The core architecture and control mechanisms of lumi‑os are based on proprietary technology currently under patent application (Patent Pending).

This ensures that the values represented by the 3C framework—creativity, connectivity, and core integrity—are realized with high safety, reproducibility, and transparency.


## 🎯 Purpose of lumi‑os
lumi‑os is designed as the foundational OS (Ontology System) of the LUMINA BULIGE universe.

Its primary goals are:

- To unify world‑rules, algorithms, and structural logic  
- To integrate seamlessly with the Riaki Language (利明語)  
- To provide a modular, extensible architecture  
- To deliver next‑generation safety and transparency through Neo‑based design
